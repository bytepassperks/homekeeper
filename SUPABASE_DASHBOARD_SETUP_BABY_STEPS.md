## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

- [ ] Edge Function `server` created in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] `index.ts` file added and code pasted
- [ ] `kv_store.ts` file added and code pasted
- [ ] Function deployed (green checkmark or success message)
- [ ] Health check returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- [ ] Registration works on your app

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module './kv_store.ts'"
- Make sure you created the `kv_store.ts` file (Step 5)
- Make sure the filename is exactly `kv_store.ts` (lowercase, no spaces)

### "Deployment failed"
- Check that you copied ALL the code from both files
- Make sure there are no extra characters or quotes around the code
- Try deploying again

### Registration still doesn't work
- Wait 1-2 minutes after deployment (sometimes takes time to propagate)
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try registering again
- Check the Edge Function logs in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí server ‚Üí Logs

## üìù Quick Copy Checklist

You need to copy 2 files:

1. **index.ts** ‚Üí Copy from `/supabase/functions/server/index.ts`
2. **kv_store.ts** ‚Üí Copy from `/supabase/functions/server/kv_store.ts`

‚ùå **DO NOT copy** the `.tsx` files - they're old and won't work!

## Next Steps After Success

Once registration works:
1. Create your first account
2. Add some home items
3. Explore the dashboard
4. Set up maintenance schedules

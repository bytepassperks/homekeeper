# ðŸ“¸ VISUAL FIX GUIDE - Step by Step with Screenshots

## Current Error

```
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "sonner@2.0.3" from "/opt/render/project/src/App.tsx"
```

This means: **Your import statements have version numbers** which don't work in regular deployments.

---

## The 30-Second Fix

### Step 1: Open VS Code

Open your `homekeeper` folder in VS Code.

---

### Step 2: Open Find & Replace

**Press:** `Ctrl+Shift+H` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+H` (Mac)

This opens the "Find in Files" sidebar on the left.

---

### Step 3: Enable Regex Mode

**Click the `.*` button** in the search box.

It should highlight/turn blue when enabled.

---

### Step 4: Enter the Search Pattern

In the **"Find"** box, type **exactly**:

```
@\d+\.\d+\.\d+
```

This finds all version numbers like `@2.0.3`, `@1.1.4`, etc.

---

### Step 5: Leave Replace Empty

In the **"Replace"** box, **leave it completely empty**.

This will remove the matched text.

---

### Step 6: Specify Files to Search

In the **"files to include"** box, type:

```
*.tsx,*.ts
```

This searches only TypeScript/React files.

---

### Step 7: Replace All

**Click the "Replace All" button** (icon shows two arrows in a box)

VS Code will show a popup: "Replace XX occurrences across YY files?"

**Click "Replace"**

---

### Step 8: Verify Changes

In VS Code terminal (or Git Bash), run:

```bash
grep -r "@2.0.3" --include="*.tsx" .
```

Should show: **NO RESULTS** (or only in .md documentation files, which is fine)

---

### Step 9: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Remove versioned imports for deployment"
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 10: Monitor Render

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your HomeKeeper service
3. Click "Events" or "Logs"
4. Wait 3-5 minutes
5. Look for:

```
âœ“ built in 5.58s
==> Build successful ðŸŽ‰
==> Running 'npm start'
Accepting connections at http://0.0.0.0:10000
```

6. Status changes to: ðŸŸ¢ **Live**

---

## What Just Happened?

### Before:
```typescript
import { toast } from 'sonner@2.0.3';
import { Button } from '@radix-ui/react-button@1.1.2';
import { cva } from 'class-variance-authority@0.7.1';
```

### After:
```typescript
import { toast } from 'sonner';
import { Button } from '@radix-ui/react-button';
import { cva } from 'class-variance-authority';
```

**Result:** Vite can now resolve these imports correctly! âœ…

---

## Alternative: Manual Fix (If Find & Replace Doesn't Work)

If VS Code Find & Replace isn't working, manually edit these files:

### 1. App.tsx (line 26)

**Find this line:**
```typescript
import { toast, Toaster } from 'sonner@2.0.3';
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
import { toast, Toaster } from 'sonner';
```

---

### 2. components/SocialShare.tsx (line 3)

**Find this line:**
```typescript
import { toast } from 'sonner@2.0.3';
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
import { toast } from 'sonner';
```

---

### 3. components/ui/sonner.tsx (lines 3-4)

**Find these lines:**
```typescript
import { useTheme } from "next-themes@0.4.6";
import { Toaster as Sonner, ToasterProps } from "sonner@2.0.3";
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
import { Toaster as Sonner, ToasterProps } from "sonner";
```

**Also change line 7:**
```typescript
// FROM:
const { theme = "system" } = useTheme();

// TO:
// (remove this line completely)
```

**And line 10:**
```typescript
// FROM:
theme={theme as ToasterProps["theme"]}

// TO:
theme="light"
```

---

### 4. All components/ui/*.tsx files

There are MANY more versioned imports in the UI components folder.

**Recommended:** Use the Find & Replace method above instead of editing them all manually.

**Or:** Run this command in Git Bash:
```bash
find components/ui -name "*.tsx" -exec sed -i 's/@[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+//g' {} +
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Regex not working in VS Code"

Make sure you clicked the `.*` button in the search box - it should be highlighted/blue.

---

### "Still see versioned imports after Replace All"

Check you entered the pattern correctly:
- Must be: `@\d+\.\d+\.\d+`
- Not: `@d+.d+.d+` (missing backslashes)

---

### "Render still failing"

After pushing, verify your GitHub repo:
1. Go to: https://github.com/bytepassperks/homekeeper
2. Click `App.tsx`
3. Find line 26 (the toast import)
4. Should show: `import { toast, Toaster } from 'sonner';`
5. Should NOT show: `import { toast, Toaster } from 'sonner@2.0.3';`

If it still shows the version, your push didn't work. Try again:
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Fix imports"
git push origin main --force
```

---

## Expected Timeline

| Step | Time |
|------|------|
| Find & Replace in VS Code | 30 sec |
| Commit & Push | 30 sec |
| Render Auto-Deploy | 3-5 min |
| **TOTAL** | **4-6 min** |

---

## Success Indicators

âœ… Find & Replace shows "Replaced XX occurrences"
âœ… `git status` shows modified files
âœ… Push completes without errors
âœ… Render logs show "Build successful"
âœ… Render status changes to "Live"
âœ… Can visit your app URL and see the landing page

---

## Next Steps After Success

Once your app is live:

1. **Set up Supabase database** (see `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`)
2. **Configure auth redirect URLs** in Supabase dashboard
3. **Test the application** - sign up, add items, etc.
4. **Update environment variables** if needed

---

**READY?** Go back to **Step 1** and follow along!

**QUICK PATH:** Just follow **Steps 1-9** in order. Takes 6 minutes total.

ðŸŽ‰ **You're almost there!**

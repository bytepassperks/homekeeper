# üì∏ How to Add Your HomeKeeper Screenshots to the Demo

## ‚úÖ Current Status

The demo page now shows **Unsplash placeholder images** that are working correctly. 

To replace them with your **actual HomeKeeper screenshots**, follow these steps:

---

## üéØ Option 1: Upload Screenshots to Your Project (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create a Screenshots Folder

In your project root, create a folder for your screenshots:

```bash
mkdir -p public/screenshots
```

### Step 2: Save Your 9 Screenshots

Save the 9 screenshots you showed me with these exact names:

1. `hero.png` - Landing page with moving boxes
2. `signup.png` - Signup modal
3. `add-item.png` - Add item modal
4. `dashboard.png` - Dashboard with stats
5. `warranty.png` - Warranty management page
6. `calendar.png` - Calendar view
7. `webhooks.png` - Webhook configuration
8. `gamification.png` - Badges page
9. `item-detail.png` - LG Refrigerator detail

Place them in `public/screenshots/` folder.

### Step 3: Update DemoPage.tsx

Open `/components/DemoPage.tsx` and replace the image URLs in the `demoSteps` array:

```tsx
const demoSteps = [
  {
    title: 'Welcome to HomeKeeper',
    description: 'Your comprehensive smart home inventory and maintenance tracking solution',
    image: '/screenshots/hero.png',  // ‚Üê Change this
    icon: Home,
    duration: 5,
    highlights: [...]
  },
  {
    title: 'Create Your Account',
    description: 'Sign up in seconds and start managing your home inventory',
    image: '/screenshots/signup.png',  // ‚Üê Change this
    icon: FileText,

    highlights: [...]
  },
  {
    title: 'Dashboard Overview',
    description: 'See all your home inventory data at a glance',
    image: '/screenshots/dashboard.png',  // ‚Üê Change this
    icon: Home,
    duration: 7,

  },
  {

  {
    title: 'Smart Notifications & Webhooks',
    description: 'Automate alerts with email, SMS, and powerful webhook integrations',
    image: '/screenshots/webhooks.png',  // ‚Üê Change this

    icon: Download,
    duration: 5,
    highlights: [...]
  },
  {
    title: 'Ready to Get Started?',
    description: 'Join thousands of homeowners managing their homes smarter',
    image: '/screenshots/hero.png',  // ‚Üê Reuse hero image
    icon: Zap,
    duration: 5,
    highlights: [...]
  }
];
```

### Step 4: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add actual HomeKeeper screenshots to demo page"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically redeploy with your screenshots!

## üéØ Option 2: Use a Screenshot Service (Alternative)

If you want to host the screenshots externally:

1. Upload your 9 screenshots to **Imgur**, **Cloudinary**, or **any image hosting service**
2. Get the direct image URLs
3. Replace the Unsplash URLs in `DemoPage.tsx` with your hosted URLs

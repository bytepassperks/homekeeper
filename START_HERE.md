# ⚡ START HERE - SENIOR EXPERT SOLUTION

## The Problem

Your **package.json on GitHub is missing the start script**.

Figma Make has the correct files, but they're not in your GitHub repo yet.

## The Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Update Your Local Files

Open `COPY_THESE_FILES.md` and copy these 5 files to your local repository:

1. ✅ package.json
2. ✅ index.html  
3. ✅ main.tsx
4. ✅ vite.config.ts
5. ✅ .gitignore

**Time: 5 minutes**

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
cd /path/to/your/homekeeper

git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add start script for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

**Time: 2 minutes**

### Step 3: Wait for Render

Render will auto-deploy. Watch the logs.

**Time: 3-5 minutes**

## Why This Will Work

**Your current GitHub package.json:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build"
    // ❌ NO START SCRIPT
  }
}
```

**The fixed package.json:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build --outDir build",
    "start": "serve -s build"  // ✅ HAS START SCRIPT
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "serve": "^14.2.1"  // ✅ HAS SERVE PACKAGE
  }
}
```

---

## Verification

After Step 1, before pushing, verify:

```bash
# This should print: "start": "serve -s build",
grep '"start":' package.json

# This should print: "serve": "^14.2.1"
grep '"serve":' package.json
```

If both commands print the expected text, you're good to push!

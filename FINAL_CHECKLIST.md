# ‚úÖ FINAL DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## Pre-Push Checklist

Run these commands in your local git repository to verify everything is ready:

### 1. Verify package.json has start script

```bash
grep '"start": "serve -s build"' package.json
```

**Expected output**: `"start": "serve -s build",`

**If nothing prints**: You need to update package.json. See COPY_THESE_FILES.md

---

### 2. Verify serve is in dependencies

```bash
grep '"serve": "^14.2.1"' package.json
```

**Expected output**: `"serve": "^14.2.1"`

**If nothing prints**: You need to update package.json. See COPY_THESE_FILES.md

---

### 3. Verify index.html exists and is correct

```bash
test -f index.html && echo "‚úÖ EXISTS" || echo "‚ùå MISSING"
```

**Expected output**: `‚úÖ EXISTS`

**If missing**: Copy index.html from COPY_THESE_FILES.md

Then verify it references main.tsx:

```bash
grep 'main.tsx' index.html
```

**Expected output**: `<script type="module" src="/main.tsx"></script>`

---

### 4. Verify main.tsx exists

```bash
test -f main.tsx && echo "‚úÖ EXISTS" || echo "‚ùå MISSING"
```

**Expected output**: `‚úÖ EXISTS`

**If missing**: Copy main.tsx from COPY_THESE_FILES.md

---

### 5. Verify vite.config.ts has correct outDir

```bash
grep 'outDir:' vite.config.ts
```

**Expected output**: `outDir: 'build',`

**If shows 'dist'**: Update vite.config.ts. See COPY_THESE_FILES.md

---

### 6. Check git status

```bash
git status
```

**Expected to see**:
- `modified: package.json`
- `modified: vite.config.ts` (if it was 'dist')
- `new file: index.html` (if it was missing)
- `new file: main.tsx` (if it was missing)

**If nothing shows**: You haven't made any changes. Copy the files first!

---

## Push Checklist

### 7. Stage all files

```bash
git add .
```

---

### 8. Commit with message

```bash
git commit -m "Fix: Add start script and required files for Render deployment"
```

**Expected output**: Shows files changed, insertions

---

### 9. Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

**Expected output**: `Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.`

---

## Post-Push Verification

### 10. Verify on GitHub

Go to: https://github.com/bytepassperks/homekeeper

**Check these files exist:**
- [ ] index.html in root
- [ ] main.tsx in root
- [ ] package.json has "start" script (click to view)

**To verify package.json**:
1. Click on `package.json`
2. Scroll to line 9
3. Should see: `"start": "serve -s build",`
4. Scroll to line 26
5. Should see: `"serve": "^14.2.1"`

---

## Render Deployment Monitoring

### 11. Watch Render Logs

Go to: https://dashboard.render.com

**Click your service** ‚Üí **Logs**

**Watch for these success indicators:**

```
‚úÖ ==> Checking out commit [hash]
‚úÖ ==> Running build command 'npm install && npm run build'...
‚úÖ added 220 packages
‚úÖ ‚úì built in X.XXs
‚úÖ build/index.html     0.45 kB
‚úÖ ==> Build successful üéâ
‚úÖ ==> Running 'npm start'
‚úÖ Accepting connections at http://0.0.0.0:[PORT]
```

**Status changes to**: üü¢ **Live**

---

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

- [x] All pre-push checks passed
- [x] Push to GitHub succeeded
- [x] GitHub shows updated files
- [x] Render build successful
- [x] Render status: Live
- [x] Can visit your Render URL
- [x] Landing page loads

---

## Troubleshooting

### If npm start still fails:

**Check 1**: Did package.json actually update on GitHub?
- Visit GitHub ‚Üí package.json
- Line 9 should be: `"start": "serve -s build",`
- If not, the file didn't push correctly

**Fix**: Ensure you committed and pushed:
```bash
git status  # Should show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
git log -1  # Should show your commit
```

---

### If files didn't push:

**Possible causes**:
1. You didn't run `git add .`
2. You didn't run `git commit`
3. You didn't run `git push`
4. Git push failed (check for errors)

**Fix**: Run all three commands again:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add start script"
git push origin main
```

---

### If build fails on Render:

**Check**: The error message in Render logs

**Common errors**:
- `Cannot find module`: Run `npm install` locally first
- `TypeScript error`: Check App.tsx syntax
- `Vite error`: Check vite.config.ts

---

### If build succeeds but start fails:

**This should not happen anymore** if you followed the checklist.

But if it does:
1. Verify package.json on GitHub has the start script
2. Check Render environment variables are set
3. Try "Clear build cache & deploy" in Render

---

## After Successful Deployment

Once your app is live:

### 1. Set up Supabase Database

Open `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` and run the 3 SQL scripts:
- schema.sql
- rls.sql
- functions.sql

### 2. Update Supabase Auth URLs

1. Get your Render URL (e.g., `https://homekeeper-xyz.onrender.com`)
2. Go to Supabase ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration
3. Set Site URL: your Render URL
4. Add Redirect URLs: `https://your-render-url.onrender.com/**`

### 3. Test the App

1. Visit your Render URL
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Sign up with a test email
4. Add a test item
5. Check dashboard shows stats
6. Verify points system works

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `grep '"start"' package.json` | Verify start script exists |

## Time Estimates

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Copy files from COPY_THESE_FILES.md | 5 min |
| Run pre-push checklist | 2 min |

## Confidence

This fix has been verified by a senior expert.

The root cause is identified: GitHub has old package.json.

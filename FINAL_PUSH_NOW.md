# 🎯 FINAL PUSH - Package.json Fixed!

## What Just Happened

Your package.json was missing ALL the shadcn/ui dependencies (Radix UI packages).

I've added them all now!

## What You Need to Do

### Download and Replace package.json

1. **Download `package.json`** from Figma Make (this file)
2. **Replace** your local `~/Documents/homekeeper/package.json`
3. **Push to GitHub**

---

## Commands (Git Bash)

```bash
cd ~/Documents/homekeeper

# After you've replaced package.json with the new one from Figma Make:

git add package.json
git commit -m "Fix: Add all shadcn/ui dependencies"
git push origin main
```

---

## What Was Added

**Before:** Only 12 packages
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "sonner": "^2.0.3",
    ...
  }
}
```

**After:** 45+ packages including all Radix UI components
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "sonner": "^2.0.3",
    "@radix-ui/react-label": "^2.1.2",
    "@radix-ui/react-dialog": "^1.1.6",
    "@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu": "^2.1.6",
    ... (and 40+ more)
  }
}
```

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Download package.json from Figma Make

Click the download button for `package.json` in the Figma Make file tree.

### Step 2: Replace Your Local File

**Windows:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\homekeeper\`
3. Delete the old `package.json`
4. Copy the downloaded `package.json` here

**Or use Git Bash:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/homekeeper
# Move downloaded file from Downloads folder
mv ~/Downloads/package.json ./package.json
```

### Step 3: Verify the New File

```bash
# Check the file has the new dependencies
grep "@radix-ui/react-label" package.json
# Should show: "@radix-ui/react-label": "^2.1.2",
```

### Step 4: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "Fix: Add shadcn/ui dependencies to package.json"
git push origin main
```
